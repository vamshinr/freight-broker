### **SCENE 4: HappyRobot Integration Demo (2:30 - 4:00)**

**[Screen: Switch to terminal/Postman for API testing]**

**Narrator**: "Now let me demonstrate how the HappyRobot AI agent integrates with our system. When a carrier calls, the AI agent uses these webhook endpoints to handle the entire conversation."

**[Action: Test carrier verification endpoint]**

**Narrator**: "First, the AI collects the carrier's MC number and calls our verification endpoint. Watch how it validates against the FMCSA database and returns detailed carrier information."

```bash
curl -X POST "https://freight-broker-happyrobot.fly.dev/webhook/happyrobot/verify-carrier" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer freight-broker-api-key-2025" \
  -d '{"mc_number": "123456"}'
```

**Narrator**: "The AI gets back verification status, company details, and safety ratings, then provides an appropriate response to the carrier."

**[Action: Test load search endpoint]**

**Narrator**: "Next, the AI searches for matching loads based on the carrier's equipment type and preferences."

```bash
curl -X POST ".../search-loads" \
  -d '{"equipment_type": "dry van"}'
```

**Narrator**: "Our smart matching algorithm finds the best loads and provides detailed information including rates, miles, pickup times, and match scores."

**[Action: Test negotiation endpoint]**

**Narrator**: "When the carrier makes a rate offer, our AI-powered negotiation engine evaluates it strategically."

```bash
curl -X POST ".../negotiate-rate" \
  -d '{"load_id": "L123", "carrier_offer": 1950}'
```

**Narrator**: "The system can handle up to three rounds of negotiation, making counter-offers based on sophisticated algorithms and carrier history."
